# Housing_Price_Predictive_Analytics_Using_Python
Have you wondered what truly affects housing prices other than outside factors such as economy, interest rates and government policies? Have you ever wondered what will be the average housing prices for your chosen location in the future? Is there a correlation between number of bedrooms a house has and its housing price? If so, the Washington Housing dataset gives a unique perspective on housing prices for future home buyers by providing over . Using this dataset with over 4000 houses that were being sold in the state of Washington in 2014, I predicted the housing prices by using predictive modeling techniques such as Linear Regression, Gradient Boosting Regressor, Random Forest Regressor, Ransac Regressor and Decision Tree Regressor. Some of the analysis & methods that I used to get the data ready for predictive modeling were: Then the models were further evaluated by using R2, MSE, RSME and MAE metrics.
