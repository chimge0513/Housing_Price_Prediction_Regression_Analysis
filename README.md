Using this dataset with over 4000 houses that were being sold in the state of Washington in 2014, I predicted the housing prices by using predictive modeling techniques such as Linear Regression, Gradient Boosting Regressor, Random Forest Regressor, Ransac Regressor and Decision Tree Regressor. Some of the analysis & methods that I used to get the data ready for predictive modeling were: Then the models were further evaluated by using R2, MSE, RSME and MAE metrics.
